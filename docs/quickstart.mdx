description: 'Get up and running with Panda AGI SDK in under 5 minutes'
---

## Installation

Get started by installing the Panda AGI SDK using pip:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install panda-agi
```

```bash poetry
poetry add panda-agi
```

```bash conda
conda install -c conda-forge panda-agi
```

</CodeGroup>

## Your First Interaction

The Panda AGI SDK connects you to a pre-configured autonomous agent that already has access to web browsing and file system tools. You simply submit tasks and receive results:

<CodeGroup>

```python Deep Research
import asyncio
from panda_agi.client import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    # Create environment for the agent to work in
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Submit a task and stream results
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Research the latest AI developments and create a summary report",
    ):
        # The agent will:
        # 1. Search multiple sources for recent AI news and developments
        # 2. Analyze and synthesize information from various websites
        # 3. Create a structured report with key findings
        # 4. Save the report as a markdown file in your workspace
        # 5. Include citations and sources for all information

        print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Data Analysis
import asyncio
from panda_agi.client import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Use local environment for file operations
    agent_env = LocalEnv("./my_workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Agent can read, write, and analyze files
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Analyze the data in sales.csv and create a visualization report"
    ):
        # The agent will:
        # 1. Read and parse the sales.csv file
        # 2. Perform statistical analysis on the data
        # 3. Identify trends, patterns, and insights
        # 4. Generate charts and visualizations
        # 5. Create an HTML report with interactive graphs
        # 6. Provide actionable recommendations based on findings

        print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")

    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Real-time Event Streaming

Monitor the agent's progress as it works through complex tasks:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi.client import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    # Stream events to see what the agent is doing
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Create a competitive analysis of the top 5 CRM software solutions"
    ):
        # The agent will automatically:
        # - Search the web for information
        # - Analyze and compare features
        # - Create structured reports
        # - Save results to files
        print(f"Agent progress: {event}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Environment Options

Choose where the agent operates based on your security and isolation needs:

```python
import asyncio
from panda_agi.client import Agent
from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv, LocalEnv

async def main():
    # Option 1: Isolated Docker environment (recommended)
    docker_env = DockerEnv("./secure_workspace")
    
    # Option 2: Local environment (direct file system access)
    local_env = LocalEnv("./local_workspace")
    
    # Choose your environment
    agent = Agent(environment=docker_env)
    
    async for event in agent.run(
        "Build a website prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
    ):
        print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")
    
    await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## What the Agent Can Do

The autonomous agent comes pre-equipped with powerful capabilities:

from panda_agi.envs import DockerEnv

async def main():
    agent_env = DockerEnv("./workspace")
    agent = Agent(environment=agent_env)
    
    try:
        async for event in agent.run(
            "Complex research task",
            timeout=300  # 5 minute timeout
        ):
            print(f"[EVENT]: {event}")
    
    except AgentError as e:
        print(f"Agent error: {e}")
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print("Task timed out")
    finally:
        await agent.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```
