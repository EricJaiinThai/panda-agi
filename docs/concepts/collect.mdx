# Collect - Create Training Datasets from Live LLM Interactions

<Info>
  PandaAGI's `collect` utility allows you to capture real-world LLM API calls and automatically save them as structured datasets, perfect for fine-tuning your own models.
</Info>

## Introduction

High-quality training data is the cornerstone of effective LLM fine-tuning. The best data often comes from real-world interactions with your models. PandaAGI's `collect` utility is designed to seamlessly capture these interactions, helping you build powerful, domain-specific datasets with minimal effort.

Instead of just debugging, `collect` focuses on gathering `prompt -> completion` pairs and associated metadata, which can be directly used for training.

## The `collect` Utility

The `collect` class is designed to:

- Intercept live LLM API calls.
- Capture the full request (prompt, model, parameters) and response.
- Structure this information into a clean, ready-to-use format.
- Send the collected data directly to your workspace on the PandaAGI platform.

### Usage Patterns

#### As a Decorator

The decorator pattern is ideal for capturing all interactions within a function, turning its entire execution into a source for your training data.

```python
from panda_agi.traces import collect

@collect(model_name="customer_support_agent_v1")
async def generate_response(query: str):
    # Your code making API calls to an LLM
    response = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

#### As a Context Manager

The context manager is perfect for selectively capturing interactions from specific parts of your application, allowing you to create highly targeted datasets.

```python
from panda_agi.traces import collect

async def run_complex_workflow(user_input: str):
    # Code that doesn't involve the final model
    agent_state = pre_process(user_input)

    # Only collect interactions for the final response generation
    with collect(model_name="final_answer_generator"):
        final_response = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(...)

    # Post-processing code that shouldn't be in the dataset
    log_results(final_response)
```

### Configuration Options

The `collect` utility accepts several parameters to customize its behavior:

| Parameter    | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model_name` | `Optional[str]`       | **Crucial for training.** A tag to identify the task or model purpose (e.g., `sql_generator`, `summarizer_v2`). This helps organize your collected data. |
| `providers`  | `Optional[List[str]]` | List of providers to monitor (`"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"litellm"`). If not specified, all available providers are monitored.                              |
| `debug`      | `Optional[bool]`      | When `True`, provides verbose output of the data being collected in real-time. Defaults to `False`.                                                      |

## Data on the PandaAGI Platform

The `collect` utility sends each captured interaction directly to your PandaAGI workspace. On the platform, this data is organized and made available for you to browse, filter, and use to create fine-tuning jobs.

Each data point sent to the platform contains the following structured information:

**Example Data Point Structure:**
```json
{
  "model_name_tag": "customer_support_agent_v1",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "My order hasn't arrived yet."}],
  "response": {
    "content": "I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please provide your order number so I can look into it for you?",
    "role": "assistant"
  },
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 12,
    "completion_tokens": 25,
    "total_tokens": 37
  },
  "latency": 1.25,
  "timestamp": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```
This structured data allows you to easily manage your datasets and launch training runs without ever having to manage local files.

## Supported Providers

PandaAGI's data collection works with the most popular LLM providers:

## Conclusion

The `panda_agi.traces.collect` utility transforms your live application into a powerful data generation engine. By effortlessly capturing real-world interactions and sending them directly to the PandaAGI platform, you can build high-quality, domain-specific datasets that are essential for fine-tuning LLMs to your exact needs.

Remember to use the `model_name` parameter to tag and organize your data effectively, making it easy to identify and use within the PandaAGI platform for all your model training efforts.
