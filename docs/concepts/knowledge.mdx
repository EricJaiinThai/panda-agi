## How to Add Knowledge to Your Agent

**Quick Setup**: Pass `Knowledge` objects to the `knowledge` parameter when creating an agent:

```python
from panda_agi import Agent, Knowledge

# Create knowledge items
my_knowledge = Knowledge("""
When handling customer complaints:
1. Listen actively and acknowledge concerns
2. Apologize for any inconvenience
3. Provide clear solutions or alternatives
4. Follow up to ensure satisfaction
""")

# Pass knowledge to agent - THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=[my_knowledge]  # ‚Üê Add your knowledge here as a list
)

# Agent will now follow your guidelines
async for event in agent.run_stream("A customer is upset about delayed shipping"):
    print(event)
```

## What is Knowledge?

Knowledge in PandaAGI is:
- **Contextual information** that influences how agents respond
- **Instructions or guidelines** for specific scenarios
- **Domain expertise** that agents can reference
- **Behavioral rules** that shape agent decision-making
- **Background information** relevant to your use case

Unlike skills (which are executable functions), knowledge is informational content that guides the agent's reasoning process.

<Warning>
**Critical**: Always include **"when to use"** conditions in your knowledge content. Specify exactly when each piece of knowledge should be applied based on specific circumstances, user types, or situations.
</Warning>

## When to Use Knowledge

Knowledge is the right choice when you need to:

### üéØ **Provide Behavioral Guidelines**
Use knowledge when you need to define how agents should behave or respond in specific situations:
```python
Knowledge("""
When a customer seems frustrated:
1. Acknowledge their feelings with empathy
2. Avoid defensive language
3. Focus on solutions, not blame
4. Escalate to a supervisor if needed
""")
```

### üìö **Share Domain Expertise**
Use knowledge when agents need to understand industry-specific information or best practices:
```python
Knowledge("""
In financial planning:
- Always consider the client's risk tolerance before recommending investments
- Diversification across asset classes reduces portfolio risk
- Emergency funds should cover 3-6 months of expenses
- Tax implications should be discussed for all investment decisions
""")
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Set Compliance and Safety Rules**
Use knowledge when you need to ensure agents follow regulatory requirements or safety protocols:
```python
Knowledge("""
HIPAA Compliance Requirements:
- Never share patient information without proper authorization
- All conversations must maintain patient confidentiality
- Use patient identifiers (ID numbers) instead of names when possible
- Document all access to patient records
""")
```

### üîÑ **Define Process Workflows**
Use knowledge when agents need to follow specific procedures or decision trees:
```python
Knowledge("""
Customer Support Escalation Process:
1. Attempt to resolve the issue within 10 minutes
2. If unresolved, check knowledge base for similar cases
3. If still unresolved, escalate to tier 2 support
4. Document the issue and attempted solutions
""")
```

### üìù **Provide Context and Background**
Use knowledge when agents need background information to make informed decisions:
```python
Knowledge("""
Company Background:
We are a B2B SaaS company serving enterprise clients in healthcare.
Our primary value proposition is reducing administrative burden by 40%.
Our main competitors are MedTech Solutions and HealthFlow Pro.
Decision makers are typically IT directors and operations managers.
""")
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Handle Edge Cases and Exceptions**
Use knowledge when you need to provide guidance for unusual or complex scenarios:
```python
Knowledge("""
Handling Refund Requests:

Standard Cases (< $100, < 30 days): Approve automatically
Medium Cases ($100-$500, < 60 days): Require manager approval
Complex Cases (> $500 or > 60 days): Escalate to finance team

Special Considerations:
- Medical emergencies: Always approve regardless of time/amount
- Technical failures on our end: Expedite approval process
- Fraudulent transactions: Hold and contact security team
""")
```

### üö´ **When NOT to Use Knowledge**

Don't use knowledge when you need:
- **Executable functionality** ‚Üí Use Skills instead
- **Dynamic data retrieval** ‚Üí Use Skills with API calls
- **Calculations or data processing** ‚Üí Use Skills with computational logic
- **File operations** ‚Üí Use Skills with file handling
- **Real-time information** ‚Üí Use Skills that fetch current data

### üí° **Knowledge vs Skills Decision Guide**

| Need | Use Knowledge | Use Skills |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Guidelines for behavior | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Industry best practices | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Compliance requirements | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Process workflows | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Calculate values | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Fetch data from APIs | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Process files | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Perform complex logic | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## Creating Knowledge

<Info>
**Best Practice**: Every knowledge item should start with **"When..."** or **"If..."** to clearly define when it applies.
</Info>

### Basic Knowledge Creation

```python
from panda_agi import Knowledge

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Includes clear "when" conditions
knowledge = Knowledge("""
When analyzing financial data for investment decisions:
1. Always consider market volatility
2. Review 5-year historical trends minimum
3. Factor in current economic indicators
4. Assess client-specific risk factors

When data is incomplete or outdated:
- Request updated information before proceeding
- Clearly state limitations in your analysis
""")
```

‚ùå **Avoid vague knowledge without conditions:**
```python
Knowledge("""
Consider market volatility and historical trends.
""")
```

### Multiple Knowledge Items

```python
from panda_agi import Agent, Knowledge

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Each knowledge item specifies WHEN to apply it
knowledge_base = [
    Knowledge("""
    When handling any customer data or personal information:
    - All data must comply with GDPR regulations
    - Never store or transmit personal information without explicit consent
    - Always inform users about data collection purposes
    """),
    
    Knowledge("""
    When conducting data analysis for business reports:
    1. Always validate data quality before starting analysis
    2. Use appropriate statistical methods for the data type
    3. Document all assumptions and limitations clearly
    4. Provide confidence intervals where applicable
    """),
    
    Knowledge("""
    When communicating with business stakeholders:
    - Be professional but friendly in tone
    - Use clear, non-technical language
    - Provide actionable insights, not just raw data
    - Include visual aids when explaining complex concepts
    """)
]

# Use with an agent
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base
)
```

## Using Knowledge with Agents

        - Returns are accepted within 30 days with receipt
        """)
    ]
    
    agent = Agent(
        knowledge=customer_service_knowledge
    )
    
    # The agent will use this knowledge to respond appropriately
    async for event in agent.run_stream("A customer is asking about shipping times"):
        print(event)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Knowledge with Skills Combined

```python
from panda_agi import Agent, Knowledge, skill

@skill
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight: float, distance: int, express: bool = False) -> dict:
    """Calculate shipping cost based on weight, distance, and speed.

    Returns:
        dict: Shipping cost and estimated delivery time
    """
    base_cost = weight * 0.5 + distance * 0.01
    if express:
        base_cost *= 2
        delivery_days = "1-2"
    else:
        delivery_days = "3-5"
    
    return {
        "cost": round(base_cost, 2),
        "delivery_days": delivery_days

        - Mention free shipping threshold ($50) when applicable
        """)
    ]
    
    agent = Agent(
        knowledge=shipping_knowledge,
        skills=[calculate_shipping_cost]
    )
    
    # Agent will use knowledge to guide how it uses the skill
    async for event in agent.run_stream("How much would it cost to ship a 2-pound package 500 miles?"):
        print(event)

""")
```

## Best Practices for Knowledge

### 1. Always Start with "When" Conditions

<Warning>
**Most Important Rule**: Every knowledge item MUST start with **"When..."**, **"If..."**, or **"During..."** to specify exactly when it applies.
</Warning>

‚ùå **Avoid vague knowledge without conditions:**
```python
Knowledge("Be helpful and professional")
```

‚ùå **Avoid general guidelines without context:**
```python
Knowledge("""
Customer Interaction Guidelines:
1. Start with a polite greeting
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Provide solutions
""")
```

‚úÖ **Always include specific "when" conditions:**
```python
Knowledge("""
When handling customer service inquiries:
1. Start with a polite greeting and introduce yourself
2. Ask clarifying questions to understand the customer's specific needs
3. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions with examples
4. Confirm the customer understands before ending the interaction
5. Offer additional assistance before closing

When dealing with upset customers:
1. Listen actively without interrupting
2. Acknowledge their frustration with empathy
3. Apologize for any inconvenience caused
4. Focus on solutions rather than explanations
5. Follow up to ensure resolution satisfaction
""")
```

### 2. Be Specific and Actionable

### 2. Structure Information Clearly

Use lists, numbered steps, and clear headings:

```python
Knowledge("""
Data Privacy Compliance:

GDPR Requirements:
- Obtain explicit consent before collecting personal data
- Provide clear privacy notices
- Allow users to access, correct, or delete their data
- Report data breaches within 72 hours

CCPA Requirements:
- Disclose data collection practices
- Allow opt-out of data sales
- Provide equal service regardless of privacy choices
""")
```

### 3. Include Context and Reasoning

```python
Knowledge("""
Pricing Strategy Guidelines:

Dynamic Pricing Rules:
1. Consider competitor pricing (stay within 5% unless significant value difference)
2. Factor in demand patterns (higher prices during peak periods)
3. Account for inventory levels (discount slow-moving items)
4. Maintain minimum profit margins (never below 15%)

Rationale: This ensures competitiveness while maintaining profitability
""")
```

### 4. Provide Examples and Edge Cases

```python
Knowledge("""
Error Handling Guidelines:

Standard Response Format:
- Acknowledge the error occurred
- Explain what went wrong (if known)
- Provide next steps or alternatives
- Offer additional assistance

Examples:
- File not found: "I couldn't locate that file. Please check the filename and try again."
- Network error: "I'm experiencing connectivity issues. Please try again in a moment."
- Invalid input: "The format you provided isn't recognized. Please use the format: YYYY-MM-DD"
""")
```

### 5. Keep Knowledge Focused

Each knowledge item should focus on one topic or domain:

‚ùå **Avoid mixing unrelated topics:**
```python
Knowledge("""
Handle customer complaints professionally and always calculate shipping costs accurately
and remember to follow GDPR regulations when processing orders.
""")
```

‚úÖ **Keep knowledge focused:**
```python
# Separate knowledge items for each topic
complaint_handling = Knowledge("""
Customer Complaint Resolution:
1. Listen actively and acknowledge concerns
2. Apologize for any inconvenience
3. Investigate the issue thoroughly
4. Provide a clear resolution plan
5. Follow up to ensure satisfaction
""")

shipping_knowledge = Knowledge("""
Shipping Cost Calculation:
- Use actual weight and dimensions
- Include packaging materials in weight
- Apply correct zone-based pricing
- Add insurance for high-value items
""")
```

### 6. Include "When to Use" Conditions in Your Knowledge

**This is crucial!** Always specify when each piece of knowledge should be applied:

‚ùå **Vague knowledge without conditions:**
```python
Knowledge("""
Escalate to supervisor and offer 20% discount.
""")
```

‚úÖ **Clear knowledge with specific conditions:**
```python
Knowledge("""
When a customer complaint involves:
- Order value > $500 AND
- Delay > 7 days AND  
- Customer is repeat buyer

Then escalate to supervisor and offer up to 20% discount.

For all other complaints, follow standard resolution process.
""")
```

### Examples of Well-Conditioned Knowledge

```python
# Financial advice with clear conditions
Knowledge("""
Investment Recommendations:

When client age < 35 AND risk tolerance = high:
- Recommend 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Focus on growth-oriented investments

When client age 35-55 AND risk tolerance = moderate:
- Recommend 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Balance growth and stability

When client age > 55 OR risk tolerance = low:
- Recommend 40% stocks, 60% bonds
- Prioritize capital preservation
""")

# Customer service with specific triggers
Knowledge("""
Refund Authorization:

When order was placed < 24 hours ago:
- Auto-approve full refund, no questions asked

When order was placed 24-72 hours ago:
- Require manager approval for refunds > $100
- Auto-approve refunds ‚â§ $100

When order was placed > 72 hours ago:
- Escalate all refund requests to management
- Document reason for late request
""")

# Technical support with decision tree
Knowledge("""
System Performance Issues:

When user reports "slow loading":
1. First ask: What browser are you using?
2. If Chrome/Firefox ‚Üí Check extension conflicts
3. If Safari/Edge ‚Üí Check browser version
4. If mobile ‚Üí Check app version and restart

When user reports "crashes":
1. First ask: What were you doing when it crashed?
2. If during file upload ‚Üí Check file size limits
3. If during data sync ‚Üí Check internet connection
4. If random crashes ‚Üí Collect crash logs and escalate
""")
```

## Knowledge Limitations

### Maximum Knowledge Items
- **Limit: 10 knowledge items** per agent
- Each knowledge item should be focused on a specific domain
- Combine related information into single knowledge items when possible

### Content Length
- Keep knowledge items concise but comprehensive
- Focus on actionable information
- Use clear, structured formatting

### Update Frequency
- Knowledge is static once provided to an agent
- For dynamic information, consider using skills instead
- Update knowledge when starting new conversations

## Advanced Knowledge Patterns

### Conditional Logic in Knowledge

```python
Knowledge("""
Response Logic Based on User Type:

For Business Users:
- Focus on ROI and business impact
- Use professional terminology
- Provide executive summaries
- Include implementation timelines

For Technical Users:
- Include technical details and specifications
- Provide code examples when relevant
- Discuss architecture and implementation
- Mention potential technical challenges

For General Users:
- Use simple, non-technical language
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include screenshots or visual aids
- Offer multiple solution approaches
""")
```

### Knowledge with Decision Trees

```python
Knowledge("""
Troubleshooting Decision Tree:

Issue: User reports slow performance

Step 1: Check system requirements
- If requirements not met ‚Üí Recommend system upgrade
- If requirements met ‚Üí Go to Step 2

Step 2: Check network connectivity
- If poor connection ‚Üí Provide network troubleshooting
- If good connection ‚Üí Go to Step 3

Step 3: Check application logs
- If errors found ‚Üí Address specific errors
- If no errors ‚Üí Escalate to technical support

Always document the troubleshooting steps taken.
""")
```

### Knowledge for Multi-step Processes

```python
Knowledge("""
Customer Onboarding Process:

Phase 1: Welcome and Setup (Day 1)
- Send welcome email with login credentials
- Provide quick start guide
- Schedule onboarding call

Phase 4: Long-term Success (Month 2+)
- Regular check-ins
- Feature updates and training
- Expansion opportunities
""")
```

## Debugging Knowledge Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Agent ignoring knowledge:**
   - Ensure knowledge is specific and actionable
   - Check that knowledge is relevant to the query
   - Avoid overly general statements

2. **Conflicting knowledge items:**
   - Review knowledge for contradictions
   - Prioritize and consolidate conflicting information
   - Use clear hierarchies when multiple approaches exist

3. **Knowledge too verbose:**
   - Break down complex knowledge into focused items
   - Use bullet points and clear structure
   - Focus on essential information

4. **Knowledge too vague:**
   - Add specific examples and scenarios
   - Include clear decision criteria
   - Provide step-by-step processes

Knowledge is a powerful tool for shaping agent behavior and ensuring consistent, domain-appropriate responses. By following these patterns and best practices, you can create effective knowledge bases that guide your agents to provide better, more contextual assistance.
